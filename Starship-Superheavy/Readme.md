# /!\ What you should know : 
- You need to rename your tower base to "Mechazilla", the booster to "Heavy Booster" (or just change their names in the code), Otherwise the computers will not know who to send the signal (no mechazilla working and code crash)
- MZ code is the mechazilla one, it doesn't need to be launched, but need to be set to "start at launch" in VAB (instructions are in the code). (= When the vessel is loaded the code is runned automatically). 
- Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or at launch
