# /!\ What you should know : 
- You need to rename your tower base to "Mechazilla", the booster to "Heavy Booster" (or just change their names in the code), Otherwise mechazilla won't know who the booster / ship is.
- MZ code is the mechazilla one, it doesn't need to be launched, but need to be set to "start at launch" in VAB (instructions are in the code). (= When the vessel is loaded the code is runned automatically). 
- Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or at launch

Sometimes I mess up and copy paste the boostback codes in landing or the other way, so if you go to the history of the code it might get confusing
