# /!\ What you should know : 
- You need to rename your tower base to "Mechazilla", the booster to "Heavy Booster" (or just change their names in the code), Otherwise the computers will not know who to send the signal (no mechazilla working and code crash)
- MZ code is the mechazilla one, need to be launched on the tower computer, I advise you to launch this code before launching starship.
- Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or at launch
- ld code is a function that you can add to the codes if you want the loading distance of kOS to change : Without this the range is at 2.3km so past that distance, the computer and tower will be virtually non-existent. So either install PRE (Physics Range Extender) which will burn your computer to hell, or this function
