# /!\ What you should know : 
- MZ code is the mechazilla one, need to be launched on the tower computer.
- Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or at launch
- ld code is a function that you can add to the codes if you want the loading distance of kOS to change : IF YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TOWER AND SUPERHEAVY WILL BE >100km, EITHER INSTALL PRE (Physics Range Extender), OR USE THIS, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND PRE.
