# /!\ What you should know : 
- You need to rename your tower base to "Mechazilla", the booster to "Heavy Booster" (or just change their names in the code), Otherwise mechazilla won't know who the booster / ship is.
- MZ code is the mechazilla one, it doesn't need to be launched, but need to be set to "start at launch" in VAB (instructions are in the code). (= When the vessel is loaded the code is runned automatically). 
- Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or when launched

# Some stats : 
- Boostback is every time <1m precise
- Landing is always meter precise, catched every time
# Things to come :
- Starship orbit
- Starship deorbit + landing
- Starship Belly flop + catch

# Actions Groups :
-AG2 : Lock Gridfins
-AG3 : Unlock Gridfins
-AG7 : start draining (at minimul drain % level)
-AG8 : finish draining
-AG10 : nothing, don't put something, you can replace it with abort but beware when you use cameras of the "del" key (because it will abort)
