I highly recommend using Visual studio code to read the code, it's better to understand.
Codes will change until it is possible to run in every situation, without manual input in the code to modify the code depending on the rocket like an universally working code.
this is the reason I will never finish the code ðŸ˜‚.
I will post another repositories regrouping all functions which could be used independently.
if you want to modify it you can credit me but i dont care, if you have advice i care
