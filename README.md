I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.

# History of this code :
I started this code in October 2024, knowing nothing of kOS. I had my exams so there was a big pause from march-august and in october it's back again and better, i revamped all of it and it's much better, still a work in progress but with some tweaking you could get a good starting point, i don't want to make this code the same way as other so there will be additions like the buoy cam that are in fact useless but that i like.
