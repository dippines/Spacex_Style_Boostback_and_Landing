I highly recommend using Visual studio code to read the code, it's better to understand.
You can credit me if you use the code but i don't really care.


MZ code is the mechazilla one, need to be launched on the tower computer.
Boostback code need to be launched before boostback start, or at launch
ld code is a function that you can add to the codes if you want the loading distance of kOS to change, it helps have visible camera feed and objects at a wanted distance, thanks to it you can put starship in orbit, while superheavy lands.


Dependencies : - Starship Launch Expansion (OLT, Mechazilla)
               - Starship Expansion Project (Starship, Superheavy...)
               - Trajectories (Predict impact position,very useful)
               - Probably RSS Reborn, especially for boostback but values can be changed to fit if                  you play on kerbin or earth
			   - kOS (Kerbal Operating System): run codes


Optional : - Starship Ground Expansion (Boca chica decal, LC39A Starship installation etc)
           - Fuel Vent
           - Vent Mod 
           - RSS (Reborn + MTE v2)
		   - OCISLY (HullCam preview)
