I highly recommend using Visual studio code to read the code, it's better to understand.
Codes will change until it is possible to run in every situation. i would say i'm at 80%, when mechazilla code will be finish and land one cleaner i think i will go on starship script, starting from hop and catch and gaining more altitude to have more precision than the other side.
I will post another repositories regrouping all functions which could be used independently.
if you want to modify it you can credit me but i dont care as the code is not that good imo
