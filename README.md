I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.
# Codes : 
 - Mechazilla : 100%
# Boosters :
 - Landing : 90 % (F9) 95% (SH)
 - Boostback : 90% (Still ~-1km lat precise when rtls so i'll try to fix it soon)
# Starship :
 - Landing : 0%
 - Orbit : 0%

 # Dependencies :
 - Starship Launch Expansion 
 - Starship Expansion Project 
 - Trajectories
 - kOS
 - Tundra Exploration


# Optional :
- Starship Ground Expansion
- Fuel Vent
- Vent Mod 
- RSS
- OCISLY (cam previews)


# TO-DO (In order)
- Fix boostback for droneship landing and superheavy RTLS ✅(15-18/10/2025) V2.0
- Fix fuel level during boostback and for landing (15-18/10/2025)✅V1.0
- Clean-up the codes (better automatization of boostback, more readable landing code) (In october)  
- Put starship in orbit / IFT-like trajectory (18-20/10/2025)
- Starship precise position landing code (October/November/December)
