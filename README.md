I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.

Thanks to DanielMoDis and the kOS and SEP discords who helped me and where I often put videos.

# Codes : 
# Starship-Superheavy :
 - Mechazilla : 75% --> Need to adapt it for OLT-B ( for now it only works with OLTA and OLTC)
 - Booster landing : 99% --> Need to Clean up
 - Booster Boostback : 99% --> Need to Clean up and have more realistic comportment
 - Ship landing : 0%
 - Orbit : 5%
# Falcon-9 :
 - Boostback : 60% 
 - Booster landing : 99%
 - Buoy cam script : 20%

 # Dependencies :
 - Starship Launch Expansion 
 - Starship Expansion Project 
 - Trajectories
 - kOS
 - Tundra Exploration
 - Hullcam / Neptune camera

# Optional :
- Starship Ground Expansion 
- RSS (Sol or Reborn)
- OCISLY (cam previews)


# TO-DO (In order)
- Clean-up the codes (more readable codes) (once codes are finished) 
- Put starship in orbit / IFT-like trajectory (Starting around december)
- Starship precise position landing code (Starting around december)
# History of this code :
I started this code in October 2024, knowing nothing of kOS. I had my exams so there was a big pause from march-august and in october it's back again and better, i revamped all of it and it's much better, still a work in progress but with some tweaking you could get a good starting point, i don't want to make this code the same way as other so there will be additions like the buoy cam that are in fact useless but that i like.
