I highly recommend using Visual studio code to read the code, it's better to understand.
You can credit me if you use the code but i don't really care.
Code will be finish when all those will be 100% :
Boostback code : 100%
Landing code : 0%
Mechazilla code : 95%
Starship code : -1000%


Dependencies : - Starship Launch Expansion (OLT, Mechazilla..)
               - Starship Expansion Project (Starship, Superheavy...)
               - Trajectories (Predict impact position,very useful)
               - Probably RSS (Reborn)


Optional : - Starship Ground Expansion (Boca chica decal, LC39A Starship installation etc)
           - Fuel Vent
           - Vent Mod 
           - RSS (Reborn + MTE v2)
