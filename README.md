I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.
# Codes : 
# Starship-Superheavy :

 - Booster landing : 90 %
 - Booster Boostback : 80%
 - Ship landing : 0%
 - Orbit : 0%
# Falcon-9 :

# TO-DO (In order)
- Fix fuel level during boostback and for landing (15-18/10/2025) V1.0
- Clean-up the codes (better automatization of boostback, more readable landing code) (Around december)  
- Put starship in orbit / IFT-like trajectory (12/2025)
- Starship precise position landing code (Around December)
