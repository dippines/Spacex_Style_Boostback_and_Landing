I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.
# Codes : 
 - Mechazilla : 100%
# Boosters :
 - Landing : 90 % (F9) 95% (SH) /see TO-DO/
 - Boostback : 95%, known issue, latitude is not enough precise (~1km) when RTLS
# Starship :
 - Landing : 0%
 - Orbit : 0%

 # Dependencies :
 - Starship Launch Expansion 
 - Starship Expansion Project 
 - Trajectories
 - kOS
 - Tundra Exploration


# Optional :
- Starship Ground Expansion
- Fuel Vent
- Vent Mod 
- RSS
- OCISLY (cam previews)


# TO-DO (In order)
- Fix boostback for droneship landing and superheavy RTLS ✅(15/10/2025) V.FINAL
- Fix superheavy AoAs to land in water at wanted pos ✅(15/10/2025) V.FINAL
- Program superheavy steering and throttle to land precisely, while cancelling horizontalspeed ➖ V1.0 (15/10/2025)
- Fix RTLS boostback(with RCS and better vectors)
- Fix fuel level during boostback and for landing (In october) 
- Put starship in orbit / IFT-like trajectory (Before december)
- Starship precise position landing code (NET 2026)
