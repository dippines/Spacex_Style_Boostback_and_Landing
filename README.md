I highly recommend using Visual studio code for reading.
You can credit me if you use the codes but I don't really care.
I'd say that booster landing codes will be finished this year (2025) and for starship I hope next year. But idk if KSA will have something like kOS.
# Codes : 
 - Mechazilla : 99%
# Boosters :
 - Landing : 90 % (F9) 70% (SH)
 - Boostback : 95% (Both) 
# Starship :
 -Landing : 0%
 -Orbit : 0%

 # Dependencies :
 - Starship Launch Expansion 
 - Starship Expansion Project 
 - Trajectories
 - kOS
 - Tundra Exploration


# Optional :
- Starship Ground Expansion
- Fuel Vent
- Vent Mod 
- RSS
- OCISLY (cam previews)

# Known errors :
 - Can't boostback if the landingposition is "before you", and if the landingpos=launchpos
